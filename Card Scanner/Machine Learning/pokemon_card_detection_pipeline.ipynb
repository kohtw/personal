       "## 1. Collect Training Data\n",
       "- Collect images of Pokémon cards from binder photos (9 cards typically).\n",
       "- Label them using [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) or [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).\n",
       "- Annotations should include bounding boxes around each card (labeled as `card`).\n",
